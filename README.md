# Paradigms of Programming Coursework, Report and Source Code

**Scenario and System Specifications**
Social networks are made up of a set of members and connections (dyadic ties) between those members - for example,
there exists a connection between you and everyone whom you befriend/interact with within a social network.
Facebook and WhatsApp are among the many popular social networks with which you may
already be a member. An interesting feature of these social media sites is they
automatically recommend likely new friends (connections) for you and other members
of the network. They use sophisticated algorithms to do so. 

However, to better
understand how this feature works, your project is to simulate a social network, analyse
connections between members, and implement a naive method to recommend the most
likely new friend(s) to members based on the intersection of their common friends. That
is, the person recommended for member X as a friend is the person who has the most
friends in common with member X, but who currently is not friends with member X. Your project will also analyse
connections between friends and produce statistics as defined in the requirements section.


The program will need to map the connections (friendships/relations) between the network members by using
appropriate data structure(s) to represent how members relate to each other. For simplicity, the only information you
need about each member is their name (or member ID). The map will represent the member along with the
connections to other members (the friends each member has). The input to your program is a file containing this map
representation and the output described in the requirements section should be displayed on the PyCharm console.
Your program should work via the console and does not need to create a graphical user interface â€“ Graphical User
Interface (GUI). There are no marks for creating a Windows-based application.

**System Features and Requirements**
The system must provide the following features and comply with the System Specifications outlined above. All the
features below must be completed individually. All network member input and output should be via the PyCharm
console and not via a GUI. The input must be validated for correctness, must prompt an error message if incorrect
values are entered, and continue to ask for valid values until one is entered or "n" is entered to stop.
